# Stock Prediction using Time Series Data

In this project, we predict stock price using a time-series model known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM models are powerful especially for retaining a long-term memory. Unlike standard feed-forward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections which enables it to remember previous states. This project models the stock price as a sequence data and predicts the next item in the sequence.
